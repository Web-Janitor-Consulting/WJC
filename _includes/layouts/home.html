                        Either way, we build fast, reliable web things tailored to what you actually need—not what some

                            <p>Fast, accessible sites built around your goals—not a page-builder’s opinion. Performance
                                isn’t a feature, it’s the baseline.</p>

                                so you stop copy-pasting between tabs.</p>

                            <p>We leave documentation, not mystery. You’ll know what was built, why, and how to keep it
                                running without us on speed dial.</p>

                        <h3>The blueprint</h3>
                        <p>We scope it out in plain language. No jargon invoices. You’ll know exactly what’s getting
                            built and what it costs.</p>

                        <h3>The build</h3>
                        <p>We ship in chunks you can see and touch. Feedback loops, not big reveals. Nothing goes live
                            until you’re happy.</p>

                        <p>You get the keys, the docs, and the confidence to run it. We stick around for questions
                            because we’re not monsters.</p>
